## Stacks

This project was built with the following technologies

### Javascript (ReactJs)

React Js was my preferred choice of frontend technology because of it's strong community and easy to use thrid-party packages.

### Javascript (NodeJs)

I used NodeJs as my preferred backend technology because why not? I mean, i can't be a JS Ninja without having a fullstack JS project in my arsenal ðŸ˜… - My choice of node as my backend also boils down to it's community and syntax being that it's still Javascript, I am very comfortable with writing codes in that language as compared to Python (eww ðŸ™‚)

### Firestore (No SQL) & Firenase Storage

I used firebase's firestore and storage as my choice of database and storage system respectively. While alot of my peers might prefer MongoBD as their NOSQL choice, I have come to love firestore since the first day I say a tutorial on it. You might call it love at first sight or whatever you may, I call it beauty.
